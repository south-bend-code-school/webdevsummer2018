      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>I have many hobbies that I like to do. For instance I like to draw and bake. Most of my hobbies are very artsy hobbies. Over the years my drawing skills have evolved. I went from stick figures to cool realistic people. It is very fun but a great challenge too! </p>

      <h1> About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Anika. I live in South Bend. I am 14 and a half years old. I currently attend John Adams High School as a Sophomore. I am a very creative person. I am a very friendly person but I am very introverted. One reason why I chose to take a coding camp was because it is very fun and it is a job that will still be in the future. Technology is changing. </p>
