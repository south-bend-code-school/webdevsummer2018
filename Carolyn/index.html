      <h1>Carolyn</h1>
      <p>I'm thirteen, and I go to Dickinson Fine Arts Academy, by the airport. I've participated in Battle of the Books and the jazz band at my school for two years, and next year I want to do it again. I play alto saxophone in my school's band and jazz, although my band teacher is still trying to talk me into playing baritone saxophone. I have read one coding book, however I don't remember most of the information. I'm here because I want to learn how to code and I want to go to college for computer programming. I've already learned so much, and I want to do this at home, too. My mom was very happy to get me out of the house for time in the summer, and so was my stepdad. I am an introvert, and I really don't like people or people contact sometimes. I'm a nerd, so I like both the Marvel and DC worlds. My favorite Avenger is a tie between Iron Man and Black Widow, and my favorite DC superhero is the Flash.</p>

      <h1>My Family</h1>
      <p>We have moved three times over the course of my life, and I have enjoyed every place we've moved to. I used to live with my dad and my mom in an apartment complex, but when my father passed away we moved and my mom and I started living with my stepdad, although he wasn't my stepdad at the time. It took my mom and my stepdad two years to get married, and they have been happily married for four years. My stepdad brought his dog from his parents' house to live with us, and we have been taking turns taking care of her. Last year, my best friend wound up in a bad situation, so now she lives with us. I call her my sister. Until she started living with us, I had no siblings, and by closest family lived in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Most of my family lives out of state, and when we don't visit them for a year or two, I start to feel homesick, even though I've lived in Indiana my whole life.</p>
      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>I like to read books a lot, and that's part of the reason I'm in Battle of the Books. I love music, and while it may not be my saxophone, it calms me down and tunes out the world. Most of the time when I'm having a bad day, I will go home, get on my computer, and I will get on Youtube so that I can listen to the music that i want to. Melanie Martinez is one of my favorite songwriters, and my favorite album of hers is her Cry Baby album. I like to write stories, and I've got two that I'm working on right now so that I can publish them when I get older. I like drawing and I've been learning how to draw anime and manga for 3 years, but I'm still not as good as some of my friends.</p>
      <p>This is Melanie Martinez's cover for Cry Baby.</p>

      <h1>LGBTQ</h1>
      <p>At one point in 6th grade I had a friend who was gay. He opened my eyes to the LGBTQ community, even though I didn't know it at the time. My sister is bisexual and nonbinary. I am transgender and gender fluid, and I am also bisexual. My mom is bisexual, and my stepdad is straight. I know a lot of people out there don't like LGBTQ people because they think it's not right, but it is right to the people on the LGBTQ spectrum. I have a favorite Youtuber, called MacDoesIt, and he talks about anti-gay videos and he reacts to anti-gay commercials and comments. One time, he actually went through his comments on Youtube, and he commented on those, too.</p>
